## Development
This extension uses:
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- **Google Cloud Translation API** for real-time translation
- **Google Gemini API** for text polishing and alternatives
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

## API Setup

### Gemini API (Free)
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Get API Key" and create a new key
4. Copy the API key

### Google Cloud Translation API (Optional, Paid)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the "Cloud Translation API"
4. Enable billing for your project
5. Go to "Credentials" and create an API key
6. Restrict the API key to only Translation API for security
7. Copy the API key

**Note**: 
- Google Cloud Translation API requires billing to be enabled, but offers free usage up to a certain limit each month
- If you don't configure this API, the extension will use Gemini API for translation (which is free but may be slower)
- Common issues: Make sure billing is enabled and the Translation API is activated in your Google Cloud project
