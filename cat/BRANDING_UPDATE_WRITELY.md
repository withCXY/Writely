## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `manifest.json` - Extension metadata
- ✅ `popup.html` - User interface
- ✅ `popup.js` - Status messages

### Files NOT Modified:
- ❌ `content.js` - Console logs only (not user-facing)
- ❌ `background.js` - Console logs only (not user-facing)
- ❌ Test files - For development purposes

### Why Console Logs Weren't Changed:
- Console logs are only visible to developers
- Users never see these messages
- Changing them would require extensive code changes with no user benefit
- They serve as internal debugging information
