# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Browser Assistant is a browser extension that integrates AI capabilities directly into the browsing experience. It provides contextual, actionable assistance to users navigating complex web environments through intelligent query responses, semantic navigation with visual highlighting, and personal knowledge management features. The goal is to solve information overload and operational confusion that users face when browsing websites.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to ask natural language questions about web content, so that I can quickly get relevant answers without manually searching through lengthy pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user types a natural language question THEN the system SHALL process the query and provide a response within 3 seconds under normal network conditions
3. WHEN a user sends multiple queries THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and support multi-turn dialogue
4. WHEN the AI provides an answer THEN the system SHALL display it in a clear, concise format using chat bubble design
5. IF the AI response is complex THEN the system SHALL provide a "Simplify" button to generate a more accessible explanation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating complex websites, I want the AI to visually highlight relevant page elements when answering my questions, so that I can immediately locate and interact with the features I'm looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI identifies that a query involves web page interaction THEN the system SHALL highlight the relevant page elements with a red pulsing animation
2. WHEN highlighting elements THEN the animation SHALL last 2-3 seconds and be visually distinct without interfering with page functionality
3. WHEN multiple elements are relevant THEN the system SHALL highlight all applicable buttons, links, text, or images

5. IF no relevant elements are found on the current page THEN the system SHALL provide text-only guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who frequently encounters useful information while browsing, I want a quick way to save selected text and AI responses, so that I can build a personal knowledge library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects any text on a webpage THEN the system SHALL display a floating toolbar within 0.5 seconds
2. WHEN the floating toolbar appears THEN it SHALL include "Query" and "Save" buttons
3. WHEN a user clicks "Query" on selected text THEN the system SHALL use that text as input for an AI query
4. WHEN a user clicks "Save" THEN the system SHALL store the selected text in their personal collection
5. WHEN a user saves an AI response THEN the system SHALL store it with metadata including timestamp and source URL

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user building knowledge over time, I want to organize my saved content in folders and generate visual representations, so that I can effectively manage and review my collected information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the collection library THEN the system SHALL display a two-panel interface with folder tree and content preview
2. WHEN a user creates folders THEN the system SHALL support nested folder structures with unlimited depth
3. WHEN a user saves content THEN they SHALL be able to assign it to specific folders
4. WHEN a user selects multiple saved items THEN the system SHALL provide an option to generate a mind map
5. WHEN generating a mind map THEN the system SHALL create an editable, structured visualization of the selected content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user seeking comprehensive information, I want the system to suggest related video content, so that I can explore topics from multiple perspectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI provides certain types of answers THEN the system SHALL automatically search for related YouTube videos
2. WHEN related videos are found THEN the system SHALL display video thumbnails and titles below the AI response
3. WHEN a user clicks a video thumbnail THEN the system SHALL open the video in a new tab
4. IF no related videos are found THEN the system SHALL not display the video recommendation section
5. WHEN video recommendations are shown THEN the system SHALL limit the display to 3-5 most relevant results

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user concerned about privacy and performance, I want the extension to work reliably across different browsers while protecting my data, so that I can use it confidently in my daily workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN it SHALL be compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers
2. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL use end-to-end encryption for all saved content
3. WHEN the extension loads THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing page functionality or performance
4. WHEN users interact with the extension THEN all actions SHALL be logged for analytics while respecting privacy guidelines
5. IF the extension encounters errors THEN it SHALL fail gracefully without breaking the host webpage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to track user engagement and feature usage, so that I can measure product success and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the plugin THEN the system SHALL log a "plugin_opened" event
2. WHEN a user sends a query THEN the system SHALL log a "query_sent" event with anonymized metadata
3. WHEN semantic navigation is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the event with element type information
4. WHEN users interact with floating toolbar THEN the system SHALL track "floating_toolbar_shown" and button click events
5. WHEN advanced features are used THEN the system SHALL log "simplify_button_clicked" and "mind_map_generated" events
